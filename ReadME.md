### BRAINSTORM: 
Problem definition: 
SOAP vs REST: our experiences with both(SOAP, high maintainence, complex protocol, outdated data transfer models(I.e SOAP envelopes), REST is the successor of SOAP)

here we attach some evidence from our project that has to do with proving the easier implmenatation of rest versus soap. First evidence has to do with lines of code comparably, and second the structure of the response of the data.
